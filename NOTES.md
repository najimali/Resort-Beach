## React Router [Quick start](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)

`import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";`

### **Primary Components of Router**

1. Routers like BrowserRouter
2. Route Matchers like Route & Switch
3. Navigation, like Link, NavLink, and Redirect

A **BrowserRouter** uses regular URL paths. These are generally the best-looking URLs, but they require your server to be configured correctly. Specifically, your web server needs to serve the same page at all URLs that are managed client-side by React Router.

**Note** - To use a router, just make sure it is rendered at the root of your element hierarchy. Typically youâ€™ll wrap your top-level `<App>` element in a router, like this:

**Route Matchers** - Switch and Route.

- **`<Switch>`** is rendered,it searches through its children Route elements to find whose path is matches the current URL.if find - render it & ignore all others else renders nothing (null).Use a Switch any time you have multiple routes, but you want only one of them to render at a time.

Note - we use exact keyword in the Route so that only the correct path matches is render

### URL Parameters

we use colon(:) & changing variable name to make url dynamic.

We can use the `useParams` hook here to access
the dynamic pieces of the URL.

eg
`<Switch> <Route path="/:id" children={<Child />} /> </Switch> let {id } = useParams(); `
